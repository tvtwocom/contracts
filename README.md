## core problems
* how to prove proof of work (viewing)

## contracts needed
1. crowdsale contract?
1. token contract (standard ERC20)
1. token manager contract (needs better name, will handle payments for work)

## current questions
* How do participants come into possession of tokens? Do they buy them somewhere?
* Is a crowdsale needed? If yes, what do these tokens do? Are they the same ones used for payments?
