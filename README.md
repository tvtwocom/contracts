# TV-TWO smart contracts
These will be the smart contracts which will power the payment system through tokens.

## ecosystem participants
1. viewers
1. advertisers
1. organic content creators (content creators)

## contracts needed
1. crowdsale contract (handled by outside party)
1. token contract (standard ERC20)
1. token manager contract (needs better name, will handle payments for work)

### token specs/requirements

Pausing is not needed due to the way the crowdsale contracts works.

#### important groups relating to tokens are:

    * 15% payable in increments
  1. supporters/advisers
    * 6% payable immediately in full
  1. marketing 4%
    * payable immediately in full
  1. contributors 75%
    * payable immediately in full

## how to run
Main things that will matter for now is testing. This can be done with `yarn test`.

Migrations to a test network can be done if running your own node. Once when a node is running on port 8545, you can run: `truffle migrate --network <KOVAN|ROPSTEN|RINKEBY>` replace network with network you are using (lowercase)

other useful commands:

compile smart contracts: `yarn build`

clear build and rebuild: `yarn clean:contracts`

clear install and reinstall dependencies: `yarn clean:install`

lint smart contracts: `yarn lint:contracts`

lint smart contract tests: `yarn lint:js`
